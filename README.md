## Project Workflow

This repository is organized into **four main stages**:

### 1. Multivariate LSTM
- Trains and runs a **multivariate LSTM** model.
- Performs correlation analysis between predicted Brent spot prices and engineering industry indicators.
- Saves results to your desktop in Excel format.

### 2. ARIMA
- Fits and runs an **ARIMA** time series model on the same dataset.
- Saves results to your desktop in Excel format.

### 3. Comparison Plots
- Loads the saved results from both LSTM and ARIMA models.
- Generates visual comparison plots to assess model performance.

### 4. Crude Oil Historical Plot
- Plots **Brent crude oil prices** across time.
- Highlights major historical events impacting oil markets.

**Notes:**  
- All user-configurable inputs are placed at the **start of each code cell** for easy identification and adjustment.  
- If you need to **change the dataset, file locations, or output directories**, update the relevant **file paths** in the code. These paths are located in multiple sections, so be sure to check throughout the script.
